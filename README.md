# Dispatch
A web3 based Twitter clone with built-in tipping system. The majority of the code is in the front-end directory, but you'll also need to get the backend server up and running as "Tweets" are being stored on Arweave.

Get the project up and running locally by:
## Back-end 
* Going to the `frontend` folder and run:
  * `npm install`
  * Add a private key to a wallet containing some Matic in PoS in `PRIVATE_KEY` in `frontend\.env`
  * Then run `npm run dev`

## Front-end
* Then go to the `frontend` folder and run:
  * `npm install`
  * Then run `npm run dev` to get the front-end up and running
